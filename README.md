<h2><strong>About</h2></strong>
<p>Retail shopping with friends has been a social experience but online shopping has largely remained a solo experience. This affects a large number of people who like to shop online but are unable to get a companion to shop with. This void of a companion in online shopping can make it boring over a period of time. </p>

<p>Moreover, in recent times of COVID-19, where the only means of shopping is e-commerce, we need to bridge the gap between friends who want to shop together online.
  </p>


<p>To bring the best of both the online and offline shopping worlds together, we propose to build a communicative web application which will facilitate the users to shop together virtually being in the comfort of their homes. They will be able to interact with their friends, get opinions on their shopping choices, and enjoy each other’s company whilst having a fun-filled time shopping online.
